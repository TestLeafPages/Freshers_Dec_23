  Java is object oriented programming language
  platform independent
  High level programming language

  Cross platform application
  server side, Dynamic web application
  web application development

Class:
 A class is a group object which have common properties,
 It is blueprint or template from which object are created
 it can contain field,methods, constructor and block of code.

syntax for Class:
 public class FirstProgram{
   -------------
}
here
   public -- Access modifier
   class  -- keyword
   FirstProgram -- class name

Object:
 An instance of class is called object
 Object is real world entity or real time entity.

Syntax for object Creation:
  ClassName objectName=new ClassName();


Maven Project:

Create a new package:
 right click on src/main/java
      ---> hover on new options
            ---> click on package
               ---> enter your package name (it should be lowercase)
                  ---> click on ok

Create a new Class:
 right click on src/main/java
      ---> hover on new options
            ---> click on class
               ---> enter your class name (pascal notation)
                  ---> click on ok




main Method:

public static void main(String[] args){

------------

}

Explain main methods?

	Main() method is the entry point of any standalone java application. The syntax of main method ispublic static void main(String args[]). Main method is public and static so that java can access it without initializing the class. The input parameter is an array of String through which we can pass runtime arguments to the java program. 

public : Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify who can access this method. Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class.

static : It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class based i.e it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class.

void : It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method which will not return any value.

main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only. It is the method where the main execution occu.

String args[] : It is the parameter passed to theÂ mainÂ method.





Methods:
========


Actions 

Syntax:
-------
public void methodName(arguments if needed ){


}

public --> AccessModifier
void   --> return null
methodName--> name of the method
() --->  Paranthesis
